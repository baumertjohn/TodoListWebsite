# Todo List Website

## A 100 Days of Code capstone project for Day 88 - Web Development

This project utilizes Python and Flask to create a Todo List styled website that allows a user to login and save a list in the database.

## How To:

There is a "test" account in the database with the following credentials:
* Email:  **test<span>@</span>email.com**
* Password:  **1234**

After logging in / creating an account you can now "add" a task which is auto time stamped.  A task can be "checked off" by clicking the square proceeding the appropriate task which moves it to "Done".  From here the task can be "deleted" by clicking the "X".

A working example can be seen here:  ht<span>tps://</span>todo.baumert.tech/

## Known Issues:
None noted.

## To Do:
Add a feature to "un-delete" a task from the "Done" list.
